# NASA Planetary Science Budget Visualization

This project visualizes NASA's annual planetary science budget from 1959 to 2022, adjusted for inflation, with a focus on the differences between the budget requested and the actual budget received. It highlights the political influence on funding through a clear, interactive D3.js visualization.

## Description

The visualization tells the story of NASA's budgetary process, starting from the President's Budget Request (PBR) to its approval by Congress. It showcases how political affiliation and negotiations shape the final budget. The interactive plot features dotted lines for requested budgets, dolid lines for actual budgets, and red and blue transparent bars to represent Congressional political affiliations for each fiscal year. The visualization enables users to explore trends, understand funding gaps, and identify patterns influenced by political leadership.
